# Git Rules

* Do not commit Magento core code, IDE, FTP, or OS files to this repo (see .gitignore).
* Do not modify Magento core code. Use only skins and extensions to customize Magento.
* Do not commit bad/broken code to the master branch.
* Do not commit code you haven't tested.
* If you need to make a lot of changes create a new branch for your feature or feature set.
* The master branch should always be shippable (i.e. working and functional).
* Warn others before merging a feature branch into master and make sure to test thoroughly before pushing to GitHub.
